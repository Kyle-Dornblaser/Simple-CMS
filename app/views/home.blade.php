			<p>Welcome to our tutorials on the basics of Web Development. This site was created by beginners for beginners.
			We&#39;ll walk you through some basics, giving you the confidence to venture out and start developing
			your own website. In no time you&#39;ll be creating and designing dynamic pages for all kinds of projects.</p>
			<p>If you were to break web design into sections, those sections would be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>HTML</li>
					<li>CSS</li>
					<li>PHP</li>
				</ul>
			<p>We&#39;ve dedicated a page to each individual topic. Also, we thought it would be good to get a little background about
			web development, so we included a little bit of information about how we got here.</p>
