<h1>A little Background</h1>
<h3>What is Web Development</h3>
<p>
	Let&#39;s start with a bit of explaining. What are you getting yourself into?
</p>
<p>
	A popular website, and good, old, trusty source of information, wikipedia delves into probably more than you want to know
	about web development. Here&#39;s an excerpt using a tag called a BLOCKQUOTE to describe, more or less, what web development, or
	web design is all about:
	<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design">
		Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.
		The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardized
		code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will
		work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.
		The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design
		of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web
		development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark
		up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

	A lot of what you already know, but a little something to get you going.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
	We might live in a world where everybody knows what a webpage is, but the history of webpages doesn&#39;t go back that far.
	And, like most things, it started with a really smart person who figured out how to do something they really wanted to do. Here&#39;s
	another excerpt from Wikipedia:
</p>
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design">
	In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later
	became known as the World Wide Web. Throughout 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text only pages could be viewed
	using a simple line-mode browser. In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there
	were multiple browsers, however, the majority of them were Unix-based and were naturally text heavy. There had been no
	integrated approach to graphical design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould. The
	W3C was created in October 1994, to "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that
	promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability." This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety
	browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues
	to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications corp. That later
	became known as Netscape Communications-the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regards to
	the traditional standards process. For example Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting
	text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate
	browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript,
	and Dynamic HTML. On a whole the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a
	rapid pace.
